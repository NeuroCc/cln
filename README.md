# cln
cln is a docker swarm experiment by the GitHub NeuroCc Org and was founded by Adamantium323

## about
This is a single instance of the swarm.  Switch to a ``multi`` branch if you want to add nodes to the swarm.  However, you will no longer be able to send emails (that would be too spammy).This software is for experiment research delivered as-is with no warranty and no liability into the public domain.  At this time, the author is looking for pull requests.  Please contact them at cln.pull.requests@maildrop.cc  

## legal
